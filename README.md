# waTer

一个量化回测框架

## why is waTer?

>You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.                         
-Bruce Lee




T for trading.

Like water, stick with one goal, be reactive with everything.
